This book is written in simple language and has adequate number of solved examples.</p><p><strong>Logical Reasoning</strong>:&nbsp;I used ‘The Pearson Guide to Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation for CAT and other MBA Entrance Examinations' by Nishit K. Sinha. It starts from the fundamentals and then moves on to advanced levels. Logical Reasoning involves various cases to be considered and this book clearly explains all the cases involved in a particular question.</p><p><strong>Language Comprehension</strong>:&nbsp;For vocabulary, I used ‘Six weeks to words of power' by Wilfred Funk. If followed religiously, it can expand your vocabulary in about 2 months. Though I have not followed ‘Word Power Made Easy' by Norman Lewis, I recommend that too. For Reading Comprehension, I used to solve 1-2 RC passages online on a daily basis. Websites like&nbsp;www.lofoya.comand cat.wordpandit.com give you ample practice for the same. Also, I made it a habit to read articles related to various topics such as philosophy, sociology, history, art, literature etc. from&nbsp;www.aldaily.com. This improves our familiarity with various topics, thus increasing our speed of solving RCs.</p><p><strong>General Awareness:</strong>&nbsp;For General Awareness, reading newspapers is a must. I had also subscribed to the GK programme of&nbsp;www.careeranna.com. It helped me a lot because a good amount of information was available in a condensed format. A very good site for GA preparation is&nbsp;www.gkedge.com. I just made sure to spend only 10-15 minutes on GA during CMAT. Guesswork doesn't work here. We either know the answer or don't.</p></div>",
